# API-Workshop
The purpose of this workshop is to introduce members to using APIs, by packaging and wrapping APIs into a friendly jar. That said, the focus of this workshop is not technical, but to show the potential of incorporating external web services with programming. This repo houses the simplified APIs.


## Soham's notes

Right now the API superclass doesn't do much, look at WolframAlpha.java to see how you implement it's few features. Will probably come up with more stuff later once you upload some code so I can see what common functionalities exist between the APIs. Also having challenges in mind would help.


Another idea that I had was to have a sort of "easy method" kind of thing. All members would need to do is have their Main method extend ProClub.Novice, ProClub.Beginner, ProClub.Intermediate, or ProClub.Pro to get access to some useful methods. Things like file reading / writing can be placed here to help members get the hang of things.
